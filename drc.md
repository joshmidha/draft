# Debt of the Democratic Republic of Congo
*April 21, 2025*

## Context
The DRC has a $500 million Eurobond maturing in 2049.  
That’s small money on Wall Street — but for the DRC, it’s a litigation magnet, especially when vulture funds are circling.  

The problem isn’t just the bond — it’s the **opaque JV contracts**, **misclassified obligations**, and the looming threat that someone will weaponize that confusion.  

## Step 1: Isolate the Ghosts
Use IMF’s contingent liability playbook (Ecuador, Angola) to classify JV debt as off-balance sheet.  
Tuck it into a legal SPV outside sovereign reach (Luxembourg, UK, etc.).  

## Step 2: Shield the Heart
Embed asset protection clauses in sovereign docs.  
Ringfence cobalt, copper, FX reserves.  
Bonus: carve a clause protecting U.S. mineral flows.  

## Step 3: Restructure the Narrative
Don’t just offer a haircut — offer performance-linked instruments:  
- Cobalt warrants (Ghana-style)  
- GDP-linked notes (Ukraine, Argentina)  
- Backed by AfDB/IFC for marketability  

## Timing & Geopolitics
Current U.S. policy in DRC is cobalt-focused.  
Use transactional diplomacy to secure alignment.  

## Expected Result
- DRC gets clarity + legal armor  
- U.S. secures minerals without boots  
- Investors get upside, not lawsuits  
- Vultures get confused
